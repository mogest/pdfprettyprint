# pdfprettyprint

A browser-based PDF pretty printer.

It includes a simple PDF parser and outputs to HTML.  Its goal is to output as close to what's in the PDF as
possible, decompressing/decoding streams so humans can actually read them and adding comments to aid the reader's
understanding.

pdfprettyprint is at the start of its life so there's plenty more helpful explanations that can be added, plus it
probably doesn't handle a whole host of weird PDF files.  Bugfixes and pull requests welcome.
